                        Ben Christopoulos is a 60 year old, male tenured Statistics Professor at UTSC. He has an enthusiastic personality -- colleagues and students describe him as a good listener, and an eager learner. Every year for the past 10 years, he has been assigned to instruct STAB22.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Ben is passionate about the material that he teaches, and wants his students to share that appreciation. Thus, he likes to customize his questions for his students (around 5 versions for a problem set), to discourage cheating. Ben cares about his students, and always accomodates when they need help. Ben assigns problem sets for students to learn -- he's not comfortable with there being unlimited tries. He wants to make it challenging and require students to retry entire problem sets if they choose to do so. And he wants to make it risky, by having their most recent attempt, the recorded one. Ben wants to know each student's progress, with regards to problem sets. He wants to know what's troubling students, and otherwise, what they find easy. From there, Ben can then tailor his problem sets for the benefit of his students. Ben likes MarkUs' simplicity for submitting assignments, as he can keep track of all assigned homework. He doesn't miss the clutter of students handing in physical papers. However, he wishes he could have students using the same system to answer problem sets. Ben wants to have all students in the same system, and he wants the homework to be organized -- into units in the course. This way, he can keep track of which problem sets correspond to which chapter.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Wanting to know more ways to help his students, he's been attending several conferences on improving class performance. One idea that stuck with him was making the homework system seem like a game: with levels and achievements to unlock. He wants to try this out on his students. 
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Ben has been teaching for almost 33 years, and he has experience in several digital platforms such as Blackboard, MarkUs, and Piazza. He is comfortable and has no problem interchangeably using all of them. He usually prepares his lecture notes and problem-sets on his MacBook Pro, whether he's at home, or on his commute to work. He is connected via Wifi, but whenever he's on the go, he uses his phone as a hot-spot.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Ben uses LaTeX to typeset his questions, because he hates the clutter and unpredictability of Microsoft Word. He has some knowledge of Perl -- he's not an expert, but he is always willing to learn new programming languages. Ben wants to make his questions as accessible as possible -- he wants to include diagrams for some of them, which he draws on his iPad. Lastly, when it comes to working with his TAs, he would prefer not to have them at all! Ben doesn't trust them, and would rather oversee all his students by himself.

                     <p>
                        Sophie Kang is a 30 year old, female Associate Professor of Statistics at UTSC. She has a more reserved personality -- colleagues and students would describe her as snobbish, and lazy. When working, she uses the path of least resistance. Sophie has taught STAB23 twice now, for the past three years.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Sophie cares more about her research with the University rather than her teaching assignments. She isn't interested in interacting with students -- Sophie simply cares that the average for her courses are not questionable to the university. Thus, she would appreciate a system that allows her to take a quick look at the course progress -- how the class is doing as a whole. Sophie isn't interested in seeing individual student's marks. She doesn't have a lot of time on her hands, and neither do her TAs. Sadly, the averages for her evaluations are un-acceptable. Sophie needs to boost the average in a way that doesn't dig into more time. She already holds weekly quizzes for STAB23, but those are manually marked. Sophie would benefit from a system that automatically marks her students' problem sets -- in addition, there isn't the fear that her TAs marked a question wrong. She wants the system to be appealing to students, by having unlimited tries for questions, but for a set time.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Sophie has been pushed into using Piazza and Blackboard because her students asked for it. She still isn't too familiar with how either of them works. In general, Sophie doesn't like digital platforms. She uses a five year old laptop that is slow and should be retired, but she can't be bothered to get a new one. Sophie only works when she's at home or at her office -- when she's alone, so that she can focus.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        When preparing her assignments, Sophie likes to use Microsoft Word because it is easier for her. She doesn't have any experience in coding, and isn't willing to learn. Sophie doesn't have a lot of time to think about different versions of a problem set. She would rather just create one problem, and change the variables to distribute to students.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Sophie relies heavily on her TAs and would prefer to give them all her work, if possible. She would appreciate if the TAs could get involved in the monitoring of her students homework progress and questions. Sophie doesn't like to waste time -- she uses her breaks to get ahead of her schedule. She frequently prepares problem sets some weeks in advance. But sometimes she doesn't have time to actually upload them at the needed time, so she would like to be able schedule those releases.

                     <p>
                        Robert Li is a third-year (20 year old), male student at UTSC, and he is pursuing a double major in History and English. He has an eccentric personality -- his peers would describe him as competitive but easily distracted.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        He is open about his dislike for statistics/math courses. He doesn't like the fact that the concepts don't 'click' with him immediately -- as they do with Arts courses. Plus, he gets distracted easily. Robert cannot focus on one task for too long. When working on assignments and problem-sets, he takes frequent breaks to work productively. He dreads problem-sets in general, and leaves them for the due date. His friends have to constantly remind him of looming deadlines -- Robert wishes that there was some way he could be notified of pending assignments, instead of having his friends do so.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Being an Arts student, most of the courses he has taken have used Blackboard. He finds the layout to be confusing even to this day, but he is able to navigate through the menu and is comfortable using it. Robert typically only uses his laptop to work on assignments or take lecture notes with simple software like Microsoft Office Suite. He seldom uses pen and paper, as he feels it is too slow.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        When Robert is not using his laptop for work, he is using it for games. He is very competitive and plays MMOs when he doesn't want to think about school. Robert only felt the need to do well in assignments when he has friends to compete with. He thinks that if working on homework was similar to gaming, it would work much better for him.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Robert doesn't care too much about his academic progress in general. For STAB22, he is simply looking to pass. Robert wants to be kept in the dark about homework solutions -- he'd rather never know them. And when receiving his marks back, he doesn't care to see a breakdown of how he lost marks. Robert only wants to see his total mark, so that he can keep track of how he is doing in the course.

                        Sonja Havaraj is a second year (19 year old), female student at UTSC, and she is pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics. She has an ambitious personality -- peers would describe her as focused and intense in her academic pursuits. She is taking STAB22 because she believes it is a bird course.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Sonja takes interest in Statistics, but it is mostly because she does well in courses that evaluate on computation problems rather than theory. She is incredibly busy this semester as she decided to take 6 courses. To manager her time, Sonja starts her assignments right when they're released. She typically waits and refreshes the course webpage frequently on the day an assignment is to come out. Thus, Sonja would appreciate if she could just get an email letting her know that a problem set has been released. Being a commuter, Sonja gets irritated when she has to hand in problem sets in person. She'd rather have a way of submitting her problem sets online, as it is more convenient. Furthermore, given her heavy workload, she finds it difficult to keep track of all her assignments and due-dates. Sonja wishes that she could just see if she has a pending problem-set, and its due date, as soon as she logs in. 
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Being a Computer Science student, Sonja has been exposed to the several online platforms that her professors have insisted on using: such as Piazza, MarkUs, and Blackboard. She is comfortable with using all of them. Sonja takes notes using pen and paper, and prefers physical textbooks instead of digital ones. This is because looking at a digital screen for a prolonged period of time strains her eyes. Sonja would appreciate being able to download her problem sets so that she could work on them by hand, and then later on type her answer and submit it. Sonja always has questions about the problem sets. The problem is that she lives quite far away from campus. Thus, she'd rather have a way of communicating with them online rather than in person.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Sonja has hopes of grad-school admission. Therefore her main priority is getting a high GPA.  After she submits her assignments, she wants to know the answers right away. This enables her to fix mistakes and attempt the problem again. She always wants a detailed breakdown of how she lost marks for any question in an assignment or a test. Sonja is determined to do well in STAB22, but needs help in doing so.

                        David Cooper is a fourth year (21 year old), male Teaching Assistant at UTSC. He is wrapping up his Bachelor's degree in Statistics. This year, he is a Teaching Assistant for two courses -- one of which is STAB22. David has an agreeable personality -- friends and colleagues would describe him as open, and always willing to help.
                     <p>
                        David has been a TA for two years now, getting his first position during his second year at UTSC. He has hopes for graduate studies and thus wants to impress his supervising Professors. David wants to show that his classes are doing well, at least relatively to all students in the course. David wants to answer questions from his students, and always encourages them to to interrupt him if they don't understand something. He knows however, that his students prefer to ask questions in private. He can tell by the amount of emails he gets from students compared to the number of questions he's asked during his tutorials and office hours. David finds it to be a cluttered setup. With all these emails, it is hard to keep track of which questions have been asked already, and sometimes he will completely miss some. Thus, he wishes that there could be a dedicated online system that can handle some type of communication with students.
                     <p>
                        Being a CMS student for 4 years now, David has seen and become familiar with online platforms such as Piazza, MarkUs, and Blackboard. He stays on top of all things tech. David uses both pen and paper, as well as his laptop when preparing tutorials, and grading. He took some first and second year programming courses and thus can do some scripting -- albeit he's a little rusty now. David had to learn LaTeX because his supervising Professors required it for when he needed to write quizzes for his tutorials. He now type-sets everything in LaTex -- tutorial notes, and his own tutorial notes.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        David wants to get great references from his supervising Professors. If asked, he would be willing to take over homework-related tasks, such as creating problem sets, and monitoring student progress. David wants to always be available, to his students, and his Professors.

                           <li>Create a controller (JavaScript) for the professor UI for viewing the list of enrolled students and adding students. The controller should have a function that calls the PHP web service that retrieves the set of enrolled students from the database, and receives that data as a JSON object. It then renders that HTML into the UI. The controller should also have a function that is called when the 'Add Student' button is clicked. When clicked, it grabs the inputted values in the form fields and sends the data into the PHP web service for insertion to the database.</li>
