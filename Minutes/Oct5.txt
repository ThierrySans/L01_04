> Done: Fides had merged the user personas as discussed on Tuesday, and switched to a paragraph format.
> Done: Cheng reordered the user stories that were uploaded by the team members. Is now awaiting review by team-members.
> Done: TA Brandon looked over the User Stories and Personas

Brandon's Comments:
> None of the user stories are particularly bad.
> Need more user stories that are specific to a persona, all of the ones we currently have  are general to professors/students
> Persona descriptions are superfluous and contain unnecessary detail.
> Persona descriptions should be specific to technical prowess of user, and their needs regarding WebWork.

> Decided: Each member will be taking another look at the personas, and each member will fix one persona. 
> Decided: We will change the personas to be describe the needs of the user, specifically in regards to WebWork.
> Decided: During reading week, the possibility to discuss with the library liaison to look over user stories and personas.
