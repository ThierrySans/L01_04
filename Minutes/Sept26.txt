Decided on java as a language
Look for modules/libraries 
Interview on Thursday 
Look over team agreement and team goals 

Frameworks to look up: java EE, 

General persona:

Mostly non-statistics people 
Most likely not the most active participants in the course/program
Could any year, most likely first/second
Not technically inept but cannot assume most competent 
May not be open to complicated interface/software
Most likely to take the path of least resistance for marks
May not like statistics at all, forced to take


Thoughts on requirement:

Mahesh: basic functionality of web work, more enticing, webwork cluttered, most relevant information in your face 

Cheng: make an easier to use version of webwork, interface simple, webwork too much information, only show one course 

Jerry: basically just remove obtrusive, look to pcrs 

Achievement system should be kept because Sohee likes it and we have to fulfil client requirements first but we have to improve it somehow

Don't miss the interview Thursday 4-5

Cheng to prepare agenda for next week
