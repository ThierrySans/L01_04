Meeting Minutes

September 21, 2017
Type: Physical
Attendees: All
> Discussed: What platforms we will be using. Tentatively decided on using Java because all members of the team have used it. Team is hesitant on building a web-application, because almost all team members have little experience.
> Discussed: Pros and Cons of creating a Java App, versus a web application. Agreed that it is easier to produce the back-end with the Java App, but may struggle with user interface. 
> Discussed: Building a web-application will better enable us to test the application, and maybe even have ‘would-be’ users, try it out.
> Decided: The team will be using feature-branching on Git, to manage files.
