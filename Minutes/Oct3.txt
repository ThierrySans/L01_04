> Decided: Responsibilities of TAs in regards to WebWork are not clear. We will be asking Sohee some questions regarding this.

Questions to ask Sohee:
1. What are responsibilities for TA? Are they involved in WebWork?
2. What is her role in WebWork, other than uploading questions.

> Discussed: The personas we came up with this week (one professor and one student for each team member), and merging similar personas.

1. Professors:
> Charles: a professor that cares about students, but isn't good at teaching.
> Mahesh + Fides: a professor that cares about students, and is great at teaching.
> Jerry + Cheng: a professor that enjoys research, but isn't good at teaching, nor cares about students.

2. Students:
> Charles + Cheng: a student with bad study habits, unmotivated and needs reminders to complete assignments.
> Fides: a student with bad study habits, but is doing well academically regardless.
> Jerry: an average student that is trying to succeed, but is struggling anyway.
> Mahesh: an all around responsible student, good study habits, and is doing well academically.

> Decided: some tasks for this week as well as reading week
> Cheng will list and reorder all user stories and remove the duplications. The rest of the team will check later.
> Fides will list and reorder all personas and remove the duplications. The rest of the team will check later.
