				<!--<div class="title_small">Hello! we are Team SoftServ.</div>-->
				<p>We are Team SoftServ, a highly motivated team comprising of five computer science students. We are taking CSCC01 because we believe that it is a course that bridges the technical, and human aspects of software development. Most of us have industry experience from various areas of expertise, such as front-end and back-end development, testing, as well as web development and design. Our diverse set of skills means that we can rely on each other (besides StackOverflow!) for most technical issues that arise. From the brief amount of time that we've spent together, we've come to know that each of our members are easily reachable. Thus, we are able to decide on our next steps quickly! Lastly, we listen -- to each other, as well as the client. We like to hear every idea and suggestion, and from there, build something that works. We are excited to learn, and work together, and are confident that we'll enjoy our time as a team!</p>

					<div class="name">Charles Ruan</div>
					<br/>
					Charles is a fourth year Computer Science student at the University of Toronto. He has experience in back-end development from his time as a programmer analyst working at CI Investments. There he learned how to create software to meet the demands of the business where the requests aren't always clear. He also has experience in quality assurance from his time as a test developer working at Caseware Inc. This experience taught him how to elevate an already functional piece of software to something greater. Working in both sides of software development has taught Charles to be creative in coming up with solutions and ensure that those creative solutions provide the best result possible.
