				<!--<div class="title_small">Hello! we are Team SoftServ.</div>-->
				<p>	We are Team SoftServ, a highly motivated team composed of five ambitious computer science students. We are taking CSCC01 because we believe that it bridges the technical and interpersonal aspects of software development. One such aspect is building software requirements based on the client's needs, thus we've made it our goal to carefully identify these needs, and translate it into a product that works.</p> 

				<p>	Most of us have industry experience from various areas of expertise, such as front-end and back-end development, testing, as well as web development and design. Our diverse set of skills allow us to rely on each other (instead of StackOverflow!) for most technical issues that will arise. Knowing this, one of our goals is to bring the best from each team member, by assigning them work that they enjoy, and find challenging.</p>

				<p>	From the brief amount of time that we've spent together, our team has come to know that each of our members are reachable. Thus, we are able to decide on our next steps quickly! Lastly, we listen to each other, the users, as well as the client. We like to hear every idea and suggestion, and from there, build something that works. Naturally, this will create productive discussions that develop valuable leadership and team-oriented skills that we can apply to future projects. We are excited to learn and work together over the semester while building something we can be proud of!</p>

					<div class="name">Charles Ruan</div>
					<br/>
					Charles is a fourth year Computer Science student specializing in Software Engineering, at the University of Toronto Scarborough. He has experience in back-end development from his time as a programmer analyst working at CI Investments. There he learned how to create software to meet the demands of the business where the requests aren't always clear. He also has experience in quality assurance from his time as a test developer working at Caseware Inc. This experience taught him how to elevate an already functional piece of software to something greater. Working in both sides of software development has taught Charles to be creative in coming up with solutions and ensure that those creative solutions provide the best result possible. Charles believes that a common goal is an essential component to a great team, and does his best to keep everyone on the same page.
