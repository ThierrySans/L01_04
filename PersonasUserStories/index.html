					<div class="name">Ben Christopoulos</div>
					<br/>
					Ben Christopoulos is a 60 year old tenured Statistics Professor at UTSC. He is an enthusiastic personality –colleagues and students describe him as a good listener, and eager learner. Every year for the past 10 years, he has been assigned to instruct STAB22.
 
Ben is passionate about the material that he teaches, and wants his students to share that appreciation. Thus, he likes to customize his questions for his students (around 5 versions of a problem set), to discourage cheating. Ben cares about his students, and is always accommodating when students want clarification or extra help. Ben wants to know how each student is doing, with regards to problem sets. He wants to know what’s causing some students trouble, and otherwise, what they find easy. From there, Ben believes that he can tailor his problem sets for the benefit of his students.
 
Ben has been teaching for almost 33 years, and he has experience in several digital platforms such as BlackBoard, MarkUs, and Piazza. He is comfortable and has no problem interchangeably using all of them. He usually prepares his lecture notes and problem-sets on his MacBook Pro, whether he’s at home, or on his commute on his way to work. He is connected via Wifi, but whenever he’s on the go, he uses his phone as a hot-spot.
 
Ben uses LaTeX to typeset his questions, because he hates the clutter and unpredictability of Microsoft Word. He has some knowledge of Perl –he’s not an expert, but is always willing to learn new programming languages. Ben wants to make his questions as accessible as possible –he wants to include diagrams for some of them. Some of which he draws on his iPad. When it comes to working with his TAs, he would prefer not to have them at all! Ben doesn’t trust them, and would rather oversee all his students by himself.

					<div class="name">Sophie Kang</div>
					<br/>
					Sophie Kang is a 30 year old Associate Professor of Statistics at UTSC. She is a more reserved personality –colleagues and students would describe her as snobbish, and stuck in her ways. She has taught STAB23 twice now, for the past three years.
 
Sophie cares more about her research with the University rather than her teaching assignments. She isn’t interested in interacting with students --Sophie simply cares that the average for her courses are not questionable to the university. Thus, she would appreciate a system that allows her to take a quick look at the course progress –how the class is doing as a whole, what percent of students are struggling with what problem set. Sophie isn’t interested in seeing individual student’s marks. Wanting to maintain a respectable average, Sophie’s been attending several conferences on improving class performance. One idea that stuck to her was the use of making the homework system seem like a game: with levels and achievements to unlock. She wants to try this out on her students.
 
Sophie has been pushed into using Piazza and BlackBoard because her students asked for it. She still isn’t too familiar with how either of them works. In general, Sophie doesn’t like digital platforms. She uses a five year old laptop that is slow and should be retired, but she can’t be bothered to get a new one. Sophie only works when she’s at home or at her office –when she’s alone, so that she can focus.
 
When preparing her assignments, Sophie likes to use Microsoft Word because it is easier for her. She doesn’t have any experience in coding, and isn’t willing to learn. Sophie doesn’t have a lot of time to think about different versions of a problem set. She would rather just create one problem, and change the variables to distribute to students.
 
Sophie relies heavily on her TAs and would prefer to give them all her work, if possible. She would appreciate if TAs could get involved in her monitoring the students homework progress and questions. Sophie doesn’t like to waste time –she uses her breaks to get ahead of her schedule. She frequently prepares problem-sets some weeks in advance. But sometimes she doesn’t have time to actually upload them at the needed time, so she would like to be able schedule those releases.

					<div class="name">Robert Li</div>
					<br/>
					Robert Li is a third-year student at UTSC, and he is pursuing a double major in History and English. He is an eccentric personality –his peers would describe him as competitive and easily distracted.
 
He is open about his dislike for statistics/math courses. He doesn’t like the fact that the concepts don’t ‘click’ with him immediately –as they do with Arts courses. Plus, he gets distracted easily. Robert cannot focus on one task for too long. When working on assignments and problem-sets, he takes frequent breaks to work productively. He dreads problem-sets in general, and leaves them for the date due. His friends have to constantly remind him of looming deadlines –Robert wishes that there was some way he could be notified of pending assignments, instead of having his friends do so.
Robert is very competitive and plays MMOs when he doesn’t want to think about school. He thinks that if working on homework was similar to gaming, it would work much better for him.
 
Being an Arts student, most of the courses he’s taken have used Blackboard. He finds the layout to be confusing even to this day, but he can use it comfortably. Robert typically only uses his laptop to work on assignments or take lecture notes. He seldom uses pen and paper, as he feels it is too slow.
 
Robert doesn’t care too much about his academic progress in general. For STAB22 specifically, he is simply looking to pass. Robert wants to be kept in the dark about homework solutions –he’d rather never know them. And when receiving his marks back, he doesn’t care to see a breakdown of how he lost marks. Robert only wants to see his total mark, so that he can keep track of how he’s doing in the course.

				As Ben, I want to add students to a course. </br></br>
				As Ben, I want to be able to create a unit. </br></br>
				As Ben, I want to add problem sets with a due-date to a unit. (A unit is defined as a chapter in the course and a problem set is a generated set of similar problems.) </br></br>
				As Ben, I want to be able to share/unlock problem sets to students at a set time, so that students start the problem set at the right time.</br></br>
				As Sonja, I want to be able to answer questions in a problem set.</br></br>
				As a student, I want to be able to submit my answers to a problem set.</br></br>
				As Sonja, I want to see the results (a %grade) after completing a problem set.</br></br>
				As Sonja, I want to be able to know when a new unit is unlocked/shared by the professor so that I can practice the material.</br></br>
				As Sonja, I want to be able to save my progress on a problem set and resume at another time, so that I can take small breaks in between.</br></br>
				As Sonja, I want the software to send me reminder email when the due date is close.</br></br>
				As Ben, I want the system to prevent students from attempting a problem set past the due date.</br></br>
				As Ben, I want to have a system that will automatically compare the student's' choice and the given solution for a quiz, so that I don't need to mark any quiz.</br></br>
				As Ben, I want to be able to track how many times a student tried a question, so that I know which types of questions are the most challenging for students.</br></br>
				As a Ben, I want to have the ability to let the TA to see what the questions students are sending me, so that I can minimize my work and let TA do my work.</br></br>
				As Ben, I want to see which questions were answered correctly by what  percent of the students.</br></br>
